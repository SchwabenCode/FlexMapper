  "description": "FlexMapper is the counterpart to AutoMapper. While AutoMapper uses primary a lot of Reflection stuff to map the values of two classes or object, FlexMapper focuses the pointedly manual mapping. AutoMapper is a great solution if you just want to map simple objects, like ViewModels or data-transfer objects. But if you're focussed on performance and want to use AutoMapper with contexts like databases or unmanaged connections, AutoMapper is complex to use and hard to test.",
